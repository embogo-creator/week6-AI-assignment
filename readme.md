## 📋 Project Overview
This project evaluates the core technical shifts and ethical dilemmas defining the AI landscape in 2025. As AI moves from centralized cloud servers to the "edge" and explores the limits of quantum computation, this assignment explores how these technologies can be implemented responsibly.

### Key Focus Areas:
* **Edge AI & AIoT:** Optimizing models for real-time, on-device intelligence.
* **Human-AI Collaboration:** Developing "Agentic AI" that works as a digital coworker.
* **Quantum AI:** Using qubits to solve computationally "heavy" biological simulations.
* **Personalized Medicine:** Transitioning from reactive care to predictive, genomic-based health.
* **Ethical Governance:** Addressing algorithmic bias and the "Black Box" transparency gap.

## 🛠 Technical Implementations

### 1. Edge AI & AIoT Integration
To overcome latency and privacy issues, I focus on **Model Optimization** for microcontrollers.
* **Implementation:** Used **TensorFlow Lite** and **8-bit Integer Quantization** to reduce model size by 75% while maintaining 92% accuracy.
* **Use Case:** Real-time anomaly detection in industrial IoT sensors without sending raw data to the cloud.

### 2. Quantum AI & Healthcare
This section explores the integration of **Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE)** to simulate molecular interactions.
* **Implementation:** Leveraging **Qiskit** to model protein-folding structures that are currently infeasible for classical GPUs.
* **Impact:** Reducing drug discovery timelines from years to months by predicting drug-protein affinity at a sub-atomic level.

### 3. Agentic Human-AI Collaboration
Moving beyond simple chatbots, I analyze **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**.
* **Frameworks:** Implementation of **Microsoft Copilot Studio** and **LangChain** to create "reasoning-centric" agents.
* **Collaboration:** Humans act as "Ethical Overrides" in the loop, managing high-level strategy while AI agents handle end-to-end data synthesis.

## ⚖️ Ethical Reflection & Governance
The assignment tackles the **"Black Box" Problem** using Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks.
* **Fairness:** Utilization of **Fairlearn** to detect and mitigate demographic parity gaps in training datasets.
* **Transparency:** Implementing **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** values to provide a "Feature Importance" report for every AI-driven medical diagnosis, ensuring doctors understand *why* a treatment was recommended.
